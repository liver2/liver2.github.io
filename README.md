# FocusWithCats

**Quick Summary:** Manually coded front-end with JavaScript/HTML/CSS and configured back-end for a personal-use productivity web app themed around cats at www.focuswithcats.com. (If website is not working, try liver2.github.io.)

**Situation:** Wished to create a productivity web app themed around cats for personal use.

**Process:** First created basic JavaScript timer program that counted down from one minute. Then, added variable fields that could be changed in-program to adjust timer length. Created basic HTML framework to run JavaScript code on a website without CSS. Implemented pause, resume, stop, and restart functions. Added CSS styling, cat-themed wallpaper, and logo. Designed and implemented custom font for use on the website. Adjusted CSS properties to make website mobile-accessible. Implemented sound effects. Implemented Github web-hosting with a custom domain.

**Result:** A simple, no-frills website for feline productivity that uses the Pomodoro method to structure work. Can be found at www.focuswithcats.com.
